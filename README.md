# VisualizeDataStructures
 
### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a web app dedicated to visualizing numerous different data structures. It’s meant to target programming beginners, who may have difficulty visualizing and distinguishing between different types of data structures. (e.g. an array vs a vector vs a linked list.) It will feature a home landing page that will navigate the user to the appropriate app page to simulate the data structures.

Since the app is targeting beginners, it will feature simple-to-follow animations and explanations that should help actual programming beginners. This educational mindset will be at the core of development.
